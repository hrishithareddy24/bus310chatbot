Overview:
This project is a course-specific academic chatbot designed to assist students by answering questions strictly from approved course materials. 
It was built for a university professor for whom I work as a Teaching Assistant and is currently live and actively used by students in an undergraduate-level course.

Key Features:
Designed and deployed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)–based chatbot to answer student queries using only authorized course content.
Implemented PDF ingestion, text chunking, semantic embeddings, and FAISS vector indexing for efficient and relevant document retrieval.
Integrated the OpenAI API via LangChain to generate responses grounded strictly in retrieved context, minimizing unsupported or hallucinated outputs.
Deployed the application using Streamlit and iteratively improved functionality and usability based on faculty and student feedback.


Technology Stack:
Python
LangChain
FAISS (Vector Database)
OpenAI API
Streamlit


Usage:
Supports students by providing accurate, context-aware answers to course-related questions.
Helps instructors reduce repetitive student queries while ensuring responses remain aligned with course material.
